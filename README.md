Use Textblob to parse keywords by the string and determine sentiment, part-of-speech tags, export in data frame.

Note: To overcome any potential minimum character limitations, I've seen good results by adding "OK Google," to the beginning of each query string. As of early 2019, I've found that a Desktop search for a typed-out query beginning with "OK Google" results in 8-10 matching SERP positions for the original query sans modifications, and matches a voice search on mobile for the same query with the voice prompt "OK Google".
